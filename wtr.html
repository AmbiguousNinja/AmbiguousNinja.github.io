			<div class="section">
				<h2 class=section-header><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
				
				<p>This page describes the policies and grading information for the evaluation of work term reports in the ECE Department.</p>
				
				<p>The work term report will be judged on both technical matters and communication skills. Each report must obtain a passing grade in each component.</p>
			</div>

			<div class = "subsection">
				<h2 class=subsection-header><a name="Report Topic">1.1. Report Topic</a></h2>
				
				<p>When selecting a topic, write the <u>purpose and scope</u> sentence/paragraph for the <strong>Introduction</strong> and <strong>Summary</strong> sections. If it implies a set of conclusions which imply a set of recommendations, that will communicate the required level of engineering analysis, insight and judgement, then the report topic should work well. In most cases, you want to approach the report as if you are a consulting engineer who has been retained by a client to investigate some issue and supply a set of engineering recommendations to resolve that issue for the client.</p>
				
				<p>It's important when selecting a topic to keep in mind that the report will be marked based on which academic terms you have completed. As you progress through the program, the technical content and communication expectation increase. In your first report, qualitative analysis may be acceptable. By your third report, quantitative analysis is. In addition, the report topic must be within ECE topics.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 class=subsection-header><a name="Confidential and Self Study">1.2. Confidential and Self-Study Work Reports</a></h2>
				
				<p>All students are expected to submit work term reports which describe a technical topic related to their work on a work term. It should be a report, written specifically to satisfy the requirements of the work term report component of the degree. Avoid any company confidential information whenever possible.</p>
				
				<p>It's recommended that you discuss the report with your coop employer during the second month of your work term. This will avoid situations where your employer indicates at the last minute that the report cannot go outside the company. ECE work term report markers will not sign a non-disclosure form related to your work term report or material contained in it. The only accommodation for a report marked confidential is the report will travel in an envelope marked confidential and only be read by one marker.</p>
				
				<p>In exceptional circumstances, you are allowed to submit at most one self-study work term report out of the three required. A self-study report has all the same requirements of a regular work term report except for the <strong>Contributions</strong> section where you indicate it is not related to your coop placement.</p>
				
				<blockquote>Note: Confidential reports cannot be considered for awards or receive a grade of Outstanding.</blockquote>
			</div>

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 class="subsection-header"><a name="Employer Marked">1.3. Employer Marked Work Reports</a></h2>
				
				<p>ECE work term reports are marked by the ECE department. In exceptional cases, the ECE department may allow at most one of the three required reports to be marked by someone outside of the department which the ECE work term coordinator has approved. This is a time consuming process and in many cases results in the report not being marked in time and the student receiving a failing grade.</p>
				
				<!-- TEMP - Is all of this necessary? Remove in favour of condensing information? -->
				<!--
				<ol>
					<li>The process begins with the student contacting their undergraduate program advisor and supplying them with the following:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Company name</li>
						<li>Student name</li>
						<li>Title</li>
						<li>Position within the company</li>
						<li>Contact information</li>
						<li>PEO registration number</li>
						<li>Name and contact info of their CECES field coordinator</li>
						<li>Title of the report</li>
						<li>Date they submitted the report to their employer </li>
						<li>Number of pages in the <strong>Front Matter</strong></li>
						<li>Number of pages in the report body</li>
						<li>Number of pages in the report <strong>Back Matter</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<li>The student's undergraduate program advisor will contact the marker and CECS field coordinator to confirm the information.</li>
					<li>Once all the information has been confirmed, the student's undergraduate program advisor will supply it to the ECE work term report coordinator for approval.</li>
					<li>If the marker is approved, then the student's undergraduate program advisor will supply the marker with:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>ECE work term report guidelines</li>
						<li>Marking form</li>
						<li>Marking instructions</li>
						<li>The following addresed to the ECE department, written on the company letterhead:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Date they received your work term report</li>
							<li>Acknowledge that the report was marked in accordance with the supplied instructions</li>
							<li>Title of the report</li>
							<li>Number of pages in the <strong>Front Matter</strong></li>
							<li>Number of pages in the report body</li>
							<li>Number of pages in the <strong>Back Matter</strong></li>
							<li>Their PEO registration number</li>
							<li>Their signature</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>Once the marker has marked the report, they would forward the completed marking form to your undergraduate program advisor along with a signed statement (including PEO registration number) on company letterhead that the report was marked according to the specified guidelines.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The student's undergraduate program advisor would keep a copy of the following in the student's undergratuate file prior to forwarding a copy of the marking form to CECS and the ECE work term coordinator:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Email from the student</li>
					<li>First memo to your marker</li>
					<li>Second memo to your marker</li>
					<li>Second memo from your marker</li>
					<li>Marking form</li>
				</ul>
				-->
				<p>The work term report would be folded in with the other work term report grades when the grades are submitted at the end of the term.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- SECTION 2 -->
			<div class="section">
				<h2 class="section-header"><a name="Report Structure">2. Report Structure and Format</a></h2>
			
				<p>The report is made up of three parts: <strong>Front Matter</strong>, <strong>Report Body</strong>, and <strong>Back Matter</strong>. The report is to use 11 point Times-Roman font for paragraph text with 1.5 line spacing in the report body. Single line spacing for front and back matter, except for Contributions and Summary sections which are 1.5 line spacing. Section headings are either 12 or 14 point Time-Roman bold font with 2 to 3 line spacing between sections. Each page should have a 1.5" left margin and 1" margins right, top, bottom with full justification paragraphs. The report body and appendices should use section numbers. The front matter is to be written for a non-technical reader, with no section numbers or references cited in it. The Glossary and References are not to have section numbers. The report body (not including the one page Conclusions section and one page Recommendations section) should be 10 to 15 pages. Only reports using single sided printing will be accepted.</p>
				
				<p>The front matter page numbers should be lower case roman numerals centered at the bottom of the page with the title page as page one. However, page numbers should not appear on either the title page or letter of submittal. The page numbering should restart at start of report body and be arabic numbers.</p>
				
				<p>Three things go into a good work term report:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Structure and format</li>
					<li>Technical communication skills</li>
					<li>Technical/Engineering analysis and content</li>
				</ul>

				<p>There are many valid technical report formats used across the industry. For uniformity across submitted reports, students are to follow the structure and format specified in this guide.</p>

				<p>The report is made up of three parts: <strong>Front Matter</strong>, <strong>Report Body</strong>, <strong>Back Matter</strong>. The report must use 11pt Time-Roman font for paragraph text with 1.5 line spacing in the <strong>Report Body</strong>. Single line spacing for <strong>Front</strong> and <strong>Back Matter</strong>. Section headings are either</p>

				<p>The <strong>Front Matter</strong> should be written in the following order:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Title Page</li>
					<li>Letter of Submittal</li>
					<li>Contributions</li>
					<li>Summary</li>
					<li>Table of Contents</li>
					<li>List of Figures</li>

				<h2 class="subsection-header"><a name="Contributions">2.4. Contributions</a></h2>
				<p>It is a 2-3 page section written in first person which clearly identifies the student's contribution to the work. The primary purpose of this section is to permit the reader to evaluate the student's involvement in the work and the student's understanding of how their work relates to the team's goals. It is not the intent to mark the level of contribution. This section includes the following information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The size of the team working on the entire project</li>
					<li>The team's main goal(s)</li>
					<li>Student's task(s)</li>
					<li>How the work term job relates to the work described in the work term report. (Note: This does not preclude self-study in exceptional circumstances.)</li>
					<li>How this work fits into the company's broader scheme of things.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The following is a suggested format:</p>
				<ul>
					<dt>Paragraph 1</dt>
					<dd>The team I worked with was relatively small/large...</dd>
					<dd>It consisted of ... people</dd>
					<dt>Paragraph 2</dt>
					<dd>The team's main goal(s) were...</dd>
					<dt>Paragraph 3</dt>
					<dd>My task(s) were ... or ...</dd>
					<dd>My task(s) consisted of ...</dd>
					<dt>Paragraph 4</dt>
					<dd>The relationship between this report and my job ...</dd>
					<dd><em>Here is your opportunity to illustrate the understanding and experience you acquired during your work term. A good work report will show evidence that you gained experience in critical analysis, good organization, clarity, and conciseness during your work experience. You could tell the reader how writing a report on your work term experience enables you to practice your skills of presentation, argument, evaluation, and calculation, and provides a permanent record of your work term. Or you could say how your work related to your academic knowledge.</em></dd>
					<dt>Paragraph 5</dt>
					<dd>In the broader scheme of things ...</dd>
					<dd><em>This is where you explain how your project or piece of the project fitted into your coop employer's goals or present projects. For example, how the piece of software you wrote fits into the company's product line.</em></dd>

				<p>It is an executive summary which communicates: the purpose and scope of the report, the major points in the report, highlights of the conclusions, and highlights of the recommendations. Keep in mind the front matter is to be written for a nontechnical reader. The following is a suggested format which normally results in wording for a nontechnical reader.</p>

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 class="subsection-header"><a name="Main Body">2.9. Main Body</a></h2>
				<p>The main body of the report should clearly introduce and discuss the engineering analysis done, with conclusions drawn and recommendations made at the appropriate points in the report body. The sectioning should effectively guide the reader through the report. Complex details should be relegated to figures, tables, glossary, appendices, or cited references. Low-level explanations should be clear, concise, and direct. Paragraph and sentence structures should be appropriate for a student in the specified academic term. Standard techniques should be used to refer to mathematics, figures, tables, code fragments, appendices, glossaries, references, etc. All acronyms and jargon should be defined when they first appear in the report body and in the glossary. Spelling and grammar should be correct, consistent, and appropriate for a student in the specified academic term. The report should be formatted in a consistent and visually pleasing way which adheres to these guidelines. All material from other sources is properly cited. There should be a minimum of three references cited (in IEEE format) in the report body with at least one of them a non-Internet source. The body must include Conclusions and Recommendations sections at the end of it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 class="subsection-header"><a name="Conclusions">2.10. Conclusions</a></h2>
				<p>The Conclusions section should clearly state what conclusions were drawn from the engineering analysis in the body of the report. They should be short (half a page to one page long), to the point, and only state conclusions actually mentioned in the body of the report.</p>
				<p>The following is a suggested opening phrase:</p>
				<p>From the analysis in the report body, it was concluded that ...</p>
				<p>ollowed by clear statements of the actual engineering conclusions and not a summary of the report. This results in a Conclusions section which communicates the required information.</p>
				<p>Conclusions should be brief, but complete and understandable. You may use lists, but easy-to-read sentences are best. Each paragraph should deal with only one aspect of the study. Conclusions may only be drawn if they are supported fully by the analyses described in the body of your report or the references cited in the report body. Three or more conclusions are expected.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 class="subsection-header"><a name="Recommendations">2.11. Recommendations</a></h2>
				<p>The Recommendations section should clearly state what the recommendations (allocation of capital, human resources and/or future improvements) to your employer or management are to address the issues and conclusions in your report.</p>
				<p>The following is a suggested opening phrase:</p>
				<p>Based on the analysis and conclusions in this report, it is recommended that ...</p>
				<p>followed by clear statements of what actions you are recommending to management results in a Recommendations section which communicates the required information.</p>
				<p>Two or more recommendations are expected.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 class="subsection-header"><a name="References">2.12. References</a></h2>
				<p>The References section must contain at least three references, a minimum of one must be a non-Internet source. Each reference must be referred to (cited) in the body of the report. This list of references must be in the standard IEEE format (as described in [2] or [3]) and include sufficient material for a reader to contact the publisher and obtain a copy of the referenced material. In addition, it must clearly identify the source of all quotations, paraphrases, and technical data used in the report. A report which fails to identify such sources shall be viewed as unacceptable and the student may be charged with plagiarism. In short, anything that is not yours must be referenced. References that are not accessible by the marker (such as Personal Communications, restricted access web sites, etc.) are not acceptable. As an alternative, if a reference is not easily accessible by the marker, you may include a copy of it as an appendix, provided it is about 15 pages or less. References must be ordered (numbered) in the sequence first cited in the report body.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 class="subsection-header"><a name="Glossary">2.13. Glossary</a></h2>
				<p>The Glossary section should define and explain all acronyms and special technical terms used in the report. The Glossary section must come before the References section.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 class="subsection-header"><a name="Other">2.14. Other</a></h2>
				<p>Proper technical writing practices are to be followed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>all figures have a number and title/caption below the figure</li>

				<h2 class="section-header"><a name="Structure and Flow">3.1. Structure and Flow</a></h2>
				<p>The topic is clearly introduced and discussed, with conclusions drawn and recommendations made at the appropriate points in the <strong>Report Body</strong>. The topic, major conclusions and recommendations are restated in the <strong>Summary</strong>, <strong>Conclusions</strong> and <strong>Recommendations</strong> sections.

				<p>Low-level explanations are clear, concise, and direct. Paragraph and sentence structures are appropriate to a student in the specified academic term.

			</div>

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 class="section-header"><a name="Writing and Formatting">3.3. Writing and Formatting</a></h2>
				<p>Spelling and grammar are correct, consistent, and appropriate to a student in the specified academic term. The report is formatted in a consistent and visually pleasing way which adheres to the ECE guidelines. Material from other sources is properly cited.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- SECTION 4 -->
			<div class="section">
				<h2 class="section-header"><a name="Technical Content">4. Technical Content</a></h2>
			
				<p>The topic has sufficient scope and depth to justify a report. The writing displays evidence of sound engineering judgement, analysis, and insight appropriate to a university student at the specified level. The technical details appear to be correct, and form a coherent whole.</p>
				
				<p>If the report is on an engineering design, the customer requirements and design specifications are appendix material but may be summarized in the report body. The body of the report should document the engineering process of transforming the customer requirements into the functional specifications followed by the engineering process to transform the functional specifications into the design specifications. That is, the body of the report is on the engineering of the product/artifact not a marketing/product document of the finished product/artifact.</p>
				
				<p>It is expected that a report should include a clear definition of the problem at hand with the criteria for evaluating a possible solution. Quantitative criteria are preferred in engineering. The report should also include the discussion and analysis of at least two possible solutions based on the criteria. Conclusions and recommendations are made within the discussion and analysis.</p>
				
				<p>In general, a report with a comparison by itself is not acceptable. A comparison may be acceptable if it is done as part of the student's own analysis of each possible solution. Comparisons are generally not acceptable for third and fourth year reports.</p>
				
				<p>Remember to cite the source of all material used in your report not just things you quoted. The introduction of your report should cite each of the references you used for background reading. If you use a figure, diagram, data, or a table, even in modified form, you must cite the source of it. Failure to do so may result in a plagiarism case.</p>
				
				<p>Remember, a report content must not be related or similar to another document that you or somebody else received academic credit for. This includes work term reports, fourth year design reports, or any other document. Violation of this may result in a plagiarism case.</p>
				
				<p>If a report does not contain sufficient engineering analysis, it will be rejected with an unacceptable grade. Remember, technical content and engineering analysis expectations increase with the level of the report.</p>

			<!-- APPENDIX A -->
			<div class="section">
				<h2 class="section-header"><a name="Appendix A">Appendix A: Marking Form</a></h2>
				
				<blockquote>NOTE: This has been condensed and is not the actual marking form provided by the ECE department.</blockquote>

				<p>A work term report examines a student's abilities to display sound engineering judgement on a topic of analysis or design and to produce a clear, concise and convincing report. Constructive comments by evaluators are given to guide the student towards improved skills in communicating engineering ideas.</p>

				<p>Each of the four criteria described below are given a mark of either:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Yes (4 points)</li>
					<li>Mostly (3 points)</li>
					<li>Marginally (2 points)</li>
					<li>Slightly (1 point)</li>
					<li>No (0 points)</li>
				</ul>

				<ol>
					<li>Structure and Flow:</li>
					<dt>The topic is clearly introduced and discussed, with conclusions drawn and recommendations made at the appropriate points in the report body. The topic, major conclusions and recommendations are restated in the Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations sections. Sectioning effectively guides the reader through the report. Complex details are relegated to figures, tables, glossaries, appendices, or cited references.</dt>
					<li>Detailed Presentation:</li>
					<dt>Low-level explanations are clear, concise, and direct. Paragraph and sentence structures are appropriate to a university student at the specified level. Standard techniques are used to refer to mathematics, figures, tables, code fragments, appendices, glossaries, references, etc. Acronyms and jargon are defined.</dt>
					<li>Writing and Formatting:</li>
					<dt>Spelling and grammar are correct, consistent, and appropriate to a student in the specified academic term. The report is formatted in a consistent and visually pleasing way which adheres to the ECE guidelines. Material from other sources is properly cited.</dt>
					<li>Technical Content:</li>
					<dt>The topic has sufficient scope and depth to justify a report. The writing displays evidence of sound engineering judgement, analysis, and insight appropriate to a university student at the specified level. The technical details appear to be correct, and form a coherent whole.</dt>
				</ol>

				<p>This is followed by a Critical Feedback section where the technical content marker can supply written comments and suggestions.</p>

				<p>The final grade for the report is calculated in two steps: technical content and technical communication. The technical communication score is found by summing up the Structure and Flow, Detailed Presentation, and Writing and Formatting scores.</p>
